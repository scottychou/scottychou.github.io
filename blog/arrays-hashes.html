  <h1>My Third Post</h1>
  <h2>Arrays vs Hashes</h2>
  <h4>10/25/2015</h4>

      At first, when I was asked the question, "What is the difference between arrays and hashes?"  I was like, "I don't know man, they're pretty much the same thing."  And you know what?  They kind of are, but they're kind of not.
 	</p>

 	<p>
	But, let's get a little more specific - we want to know exactly what makes them different, because yaknow, if they were the same thing, that would just be plain ol' stupid.
	</p>

	For the purposes of this blog, I'll be explaining it in "English."  At the simple level, an array is a list of things.  A thing can be anything.  A number, a letter, an apple, a name, your mom, anything.  At the simplest level, a hash is a list of pairs that have keys and values.  In case that wasn't clear, a pair would be 'key:value'.  For example, 'name:Scott', 'age:27', 'comment:'man, I'm old''.
	</p>

	<p>
	Okay, we can make it relevant.  Let's make a straight list of groceries I need to go buy, in other words, an array.  eg)

	```
	groceries = ['eggs', 'rice', 'teriyaki sauce', 'vegetables', 'chicken breast'].  
	```
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In another example, let's make a list of my top 3 favorite disney movies, this will be a hash.
	```
	my_faves = {
	:Aladdin => 1
	:Mulan => 2
	:Frozen => 3
	}
	```
	See? This hash associates the numbers: 1, 2, and 3 with my favorite movies now.

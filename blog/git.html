      This first paragraph will describe what the benefits of version control are.  To my understanding, version control is basically saving your work often so you are able to go back to a previous save point or check point.  That way, if you all of a sudden find bugs in your code, you can restore your code to a previous check point when the bug was not yet introduced.

        This second paragraph will explain how git helps you keep track of changes.  Git helps you keep track of changes by allowing you use of the "git log" command.  It'll show you the history of when the commits were made.  It also allows you to enter good commit messages to help commentate on what changes were made on a particular commit.

        This third paragraph will explain why to use GitHub to store your code.  GitHub is great because it is a remove version of git.  It is a place where you virtually store your code and allows anyone with an internet connection to be able to view it.It also allows you to see all previous commits and work leading up to what you currently have.

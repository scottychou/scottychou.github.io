      What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes and ID’s address degrees of specificity; ID’s are unique and utilized to identify one element on the page, while classes can be used to classify and isolate one element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “‘class selector” targets its element based on its class attribute. If a given “‘class selector” wraps other elements in the html document, it may be designated as such. For example, “container” pertains to the body element within the screenshot of the depicted HTML, corresponding to the CSS file below; additionally the class “main-header” corresponds to the CSS parent “.main-header“-please refer to the screenshot for details.

        So, in this case, the respective class selectors for the header and footer, result in different font colors. An ID selector will target more specific elements like “main-content,” denoted on the HTML page, which is prefaced by a “#” on the CSS page. This separation of content from presentation is good practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ID Selector targets an element according to the ID attribute. An element can only have one ID on the HTML page corresponding to the same ID name located on the CSS page. ID’s are unique to the page, consequently, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE PAGE WITH THE SAME ID NAME. When a CSS property is inherited, the value is determined by the parent elements, or in the example case, “#main-content.”

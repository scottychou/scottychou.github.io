					<h2>Understanding Enumerables</h2>
					<p>Enumerables are a useful module that allows you to access many powerful methods if you implement your Class/collection as an Enumerable. There are several built-in Enumerable collection classes in Ruby such as arrays and hashes. It is often worth the effort to implement your own collection classes as an Enumerable as you get all of the Enumerable methods for "free". One very common and useful method is .each which allows you to quickly iterate through each item in the Enumerable.</p>
					<h2>Understanding Enumerable#map</h2>
					<p>The map method allows you to quickly apply a block of code to every element in an enumerable. This can be useful in cases where you want to perform the same function on every single element, such as square the elements or add a constant to the elements. The below example shows how to compute the sum of the squares from 1 to 10 quickly using map in conjunction with reduce.</p>
					<p><pre><code>
	nums = (1..10)
	sum = nums.map(|i| i*i).reduce(:+)
					</code></pre></p>

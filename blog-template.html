      What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes and ID’s address degrees of specificity; ID’s are unique and utilized to identify one element on the page, while classes can be used to classify and isolate one element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “‘class selector” targets its element based on its class attribute. If a given “‘class selector” wraps other elements in the html document, it may be designated as such. For example, “container” pertains to the body element within the screenshot of the depicted HTML, corresponding to the CSS file below; additionally the class “main-header” corresponds to the CSS parent “.main-header“-please refer to the screenshot for details.
      </p>
      <img src="">
      <img src="">
      <p>
        So, in this case, the respective class selectors for the header and footer, result in different font colors. An ID selector will target more specific elements like “main-content,” denoted on the HTML page, which is prefaced by a “#” on the CSS page. This separation of content from presentation is good practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ID Selector targets an element according to the ID attribute. An element can only have one ID on the HTML page corresponding to the same ID name located on the CSS page. ID’s are unique to the page, consequently, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE PAGE WITH THE SAME ID NAME. When a CSS property is inherited, the value is determined by the parent elements, or in the example case, “#main-content.”

    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  -I felt like wireframing with a pair was unnecessary, and it felt more appropriate to treat it as an independent task.  Instead, we alotted 20 minutes of time to make our own wireframes, then reconvened and shared our work.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  -Yes, I found wireframing to be helpful.  I think that wireframing will be useful in the development in a clear and organized web page.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
    -We decided that a good wireframe would highlight all the most important elements of a web page.  Such as title, body, appropriate headers and header sizes, along with links.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
    -I learned about the <article> and <nav>, which are useful HTML5 elements.

    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  -I felt like wireframing with a pair was unnecessary, and it felt more appropriate to treat it as an independent task.  Instead, we alotted 20 minutes of time to make our own wireframes, then reconvened and shared our work.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  -Yes, I found wireframing to be helpful.  I think that wireframing will be useful in the development in a clear and organized web page.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
    -We decided that a good wireframe would highlight all the most important elements of a web page.  Such as title, body, appropriate headers and header sizes, along with links.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
    -I learned about the <article> and <nav>, which are useful HTML5 elements.
